"""
This file contains the signatures of two additiona procedures to be
implemented in the interface.py module.

The first is an optional replacement for list_images which does not return
the comments on each image. It is tested in a revised version of level2_unit.py
included in this folder.

The second returns the images for a given user and is tested in level3_unit.py

Copy these procedures into your interface.py module.

def list_images_for_user(db, useremail):
